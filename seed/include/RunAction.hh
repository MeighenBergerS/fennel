/// - Edep in target
/// - Track length in target
/// The same values are also saved in the ntuple.
/// The histograms and ntuple are saved in the output file in a format
/// accoring to a selected technology in B4Analysis.hh.

/// In EndOfRunAction(), the accumulated statistic and computed 
/// dispersion is printed.
